My own built js version of chromedriver on express with EJS
I some pythons versions as well.
Too much spaghetti to untangle in the original web-crawler with no access to the lib.vendors etc
This one is ready to update new endpoints and has a little style built in
error handling and //comments for scalabilty as I go and will go back but need enpoints or apis
